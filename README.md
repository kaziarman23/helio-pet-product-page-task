🔗 **[Live Preview](https://your-deployment-link.com)**  


## 📌 Task Overview

This project is a submission for an internship task where I was asked to replicate a product page design from Figma and implement a functional cart drawer, similar to the one on Rongbaz.com.au.

### 🎯 Key Requirements Fulfilled

- ✅ Pixel-perfect implementation of the **product section** from Figma (both desktop and mobile responsive).
- ✅ Fully functional **cart drawer** that slides in from the right on "Add to Cart".
- ✅ Accurate price calculations (Selling & Compare prices) based on quantity.
- ✅ Quantity selector with limits (min: 1, max: 10).
- ✅ Cart drawer includes:
  - Product details
  - Quantity adjustment
  - Delete functionality
- ✅ Persistent cart state using `localStorage` (retained on page refresh).
- ✅ Follows the restriction: **Raw HTML, CSS, JavaScript only** — no frameworks or libraries used.
